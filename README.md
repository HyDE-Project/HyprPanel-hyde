### Wallbash Template for HyprPanel

This template is designed for use with HyprPanel. For more information, visit [HyprPanel](https://hyprpanel.com/).

> **NOTE:** This is not a standalone package. Ensure you have HyDe installed and a working HyprPanel setup.

## Usage

Add the file [/hyprpanel.dcol](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyprPanel/blob/3f20c8922d7c3547688a2b16eb74846170a9f224/hyprpanel.dcol) to either `~/.config/hyde/wallbash/Wall-Ways` or `~/.config/hyde/wallbash/Wall-Dcol`.

## Optional
The panel pretty much comes with its own set of defaults, but if you would like to use the old hyprdots stuffs, you can use the `hyprpanel_config.json`

### Difference Between Wall-Ways and Wall-Dcol

- **Wall-Ways**: This file is always used regardless of the theme mode or wallbash mode.
- **Wall-Dcol**: This file attempts to find the theme template (if in theme mode) and falls back to using the dominant color of the wallpapers if no template is available.

### Using This Template for Themes

1. **Header Line**:
    ```sh
    ${cacheDir}/landing/wallbash-hyprpanel.json | ags -r "useTheme('${cacheDir}/landing/wallbash-hyprpanel.json')"
    ```
    This command sets the theme using the cached wallbash-generated `.json` file.
    `$cacheDir` is the path to `~/.cache/hyde/`.

2. **Wallbash Generation**:
    ```sh
    ${cacheDir}/landing/wallbash-hyprpanel.json
    ```
    This command generates the wallbash `.json` file.

3. **Optional Command**:
    ```sh
    ags -r "useTheme('${cacheDir}/landing/wallbash-hyprpanel.json')"
    ```
    This command uses the cached wallbash-generated `.json` file to set the theme.
